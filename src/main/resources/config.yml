#Amount of heat from a gun firing.
#Multiple guns firing on the same game tick will trick the plugin into thinking they're one shot
#So you may want to require players to space the shots on their ships out over multiple ticks

#Heat Sink Blocks have a multiplier associated with them that modifies the amount of heat capacity they give compared to base blocks
#For instance a block with a value of 10 will give 10 times as much heat capacity per block compared to a normal block
#Fractional, zero, or negative values also work, for blocks that contribute less to or even reduce a ship's heat capacity

#Similar to Heat Sink Blocks, but for heat dissipation instead
#Each block of these materials will contribute [multiplier] times as much to the craft's heat dissipation

#Has a minimal effect on lag, but decreasing this will increase the frequency of disasters.
